yapping |  obkie hi im papika. it's been a while since i've programmed, but i got an email from github that informed me of the summer of making hack club thingy, and i saw it as an opportinuty to get back into the hobby!
        |  c# is the only language i partially know, (apart from minecraft commands) i learnt it from my ex! she's very smartsies and wanted to teach me (so sweet <3) but i stopped practicing once we got more distant.
        |  but my ideas have not stopped flowing! and im glad to have an opporitunity to learn again~! plus im taking comp sci next year and it's good to back into programming for it.

why     | i've always wanted to make a fast paced game that required finesse and people could get good at and look awesome playing! 
        | i find it super enjoyable when games make it feel like you're playing the keyboard like an instrument, and i wanted to recreate that feeling as best as possible. so i came up with this simple game.

concept | utilizing your keyboard, or maybe your mouse, or maybe a numpad.. (haven't decided yet) you have to fill out possible operands that result in a given answer as quickly and accurately as possible.
        | I plan for there to be multiple levels and variations of the gameplay, for example: time limits, rythmic play, gcf finding, and factor finding. I plan to add more as i develop the base concept nya

| i plan to add to this as i develop the program more and come up with new ideas! i only know how to create winforms so i'll try in use winforms as my platform/engine thingy, but i expect to have to shift to other platforms/engines in order to better actualize the concept.
